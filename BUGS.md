Moving instruments off stage doesn't work.
===

If the instrument is dragged onto an idle instrument's hitbox, 
the instrument goes back to the center,
instead of returning to its home.
The idle instrument must be in its base;
dropping over an empty base works correctly.

Two instruments on the same tile.
===

If seat at 5 oclock is taken,
dropping an instrument at just the right place
(near top) causes them to occupy same seat.

Applies to all seats.

Dropping an instrument onto a button displays its 'clicked' animation
===

Shouldn't do that.
