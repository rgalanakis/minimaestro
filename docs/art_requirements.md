# Icon

Silouette of a child conductor against an image of instruments on stage.
Or musical notes if that doesn't look good.

# Logo

Not sure, but should contain app name (Mini Maestro).

# Menu

No text.
Icons for:

- Play: Something musical?

# Game Background

Center area should be like an orchestra pit, either elevated or recessed.

# Instruments

Not sure about the visuals. Perhaps like the Symphony in B toy?
Looking sort of 3D, soft and warming, but still very colorful.

# Game Buttons

Buttons should look like buttons, be colorful, and have clear meaning:

- Play is the 'Play' triangle.
- Stop if the 'Stop' square.
- Random should be the 'Shuffle' arrows like <http://bit.ly/1gVEQwm>
- Section buttons should look like an iconic instrument from that section.
  Probably: trumpet, violin, drum, and flute.
- Menu button, not sure, but should probably look a bit different from the
  other buttons, like a pull-down tab.
