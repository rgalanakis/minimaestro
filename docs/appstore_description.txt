Be a maestro!

Conduct an orchestra to create beautiful music.
Change the instruments on stage to
transform the symphony.

Mini Maestro features:

- 11 instruments and 5 songs. Endless combinations!
- Choose from trumpet, tuba, french horn, flute,
  clarinet, drums, cymbals, xylophone, piano, harp, and violin.
- Learn the instruments and their sections in an orchestra.
- NO ADS and NO IN APP PURCHASES, ever.
  We are parents and know how annoying they are.

Mini Maestro is for children ages 2-10,
though adults will enjoy it as well.
How a child uses Mini Maestro changes with age.
Younger children use the Randomize feature and dance to the music.
Older children and adults enjoy trying out combinations of instruments,
and learning about the music, composers, and lyrics.

Mini Maestro is a game about enjoying music.
It is inspired by a toy my mother bought for my first son.
I saw how much fun he got out of it:
exploring instruments, learning classical songs, and just dancing like a madman.
Mini Maestro aspires to deliver this same joy but in a digital form.
I hope you enjoy playing Mini Maestro as much as we enjoyed making it!
